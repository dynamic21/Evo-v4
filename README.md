# Evo-v4

Evolve artificial general intelligence through a brain-like agent model and evolution based training method.

## Current Goals

- Implement a prototype version using nodes and connections
- Getting an abstract environment to evolve the agents on

## Currently Working On

- Agents evolving basic instincts to a given time based environment
- Getting a sort of memory instinct evolved

## How It works

- Structure models are evolved over time within groups
- Specimen under a certain model are put against a percentage of the specimens in the same group
- The specimen are then chosen, mutated, as well as diversified
- The values contained within these models are evolved after every specimen to specimen cycle
- The structure of the models are evolved after the all the models under the group are stable enough to be compared with each other
- The models are then chosen, mutated, as well as diversified and the cycle repeats
